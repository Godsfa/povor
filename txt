In the context of Linux file permissions, the three digits in the octal number represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. Each digit is a combination of three binary bits, where:

- The first digit (leftmost) represents the owner's permissions.
- The second digit represents the group's permissions.
- The third digit (rightmost) represents permissions for other users.

In octal notation, the three digits are as follows:

- 0: No permissions (---)
- 1: Execute permission (--x)
- 2: Write permission (-w-)
- 3: Write and execute permissions (-wx)
- 4: Read permission (r--)
- 5: Read and execute permissions (r-x)
- 6: Read and write permissions (rw-)
- 7: Read, write, and execute permissions (rwx)

So, the octal value 007 means that the owner and group have no permissions (0) while others have read, write, and execute permissions (rwx). In symbolic notation, this is represented as "-------rwx".
